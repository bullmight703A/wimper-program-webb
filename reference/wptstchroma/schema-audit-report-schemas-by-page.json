I began my career in 1991 as a substitute teacher for a Preschool class.Not knowing that I was walking into my purpose. After three months of working. I became third in charge. Well after that I must say things begin to develop. I started keeping kids at home and later opened up my first center as director and owner in 1994.I had a great 24 years running Nursery Rhymes Child Care Center. In those  years I went on to get my TCC. In  2018 I had to make one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make and that was  to close my business. \r\n\r\nI am currently in school, with 6 credits left  before I obtain my Bachelor of Science in Business. I am the proud mother of one handsome son and a beautiful grandson. I love my God .Dancing, spreading time with family and friends and watching sports."

        "description": "Hello my name is Lanitra Smith, I go by Ms. Nickey in the Child Development industry. I began my career in 1991 as a substitute teacher for a Preschool class.Not knowing that I was walking into my purpose. After three months of working. I became third in charge. Well after that I must say things begin to develop. I started keeping kids at home and later opened up my first center as director and owner in 1994.I had a great 24 years running Nursery Rhymes Child Care Center. In those  years I went on to get my TCC. In  2018 I had to make one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make and that was  to close my business. \r\n\r\nI am currently in school, with 6 credits left  before I obtain my Bachelor of Science in Business. I am the proud mother of one handsome son and a beautiful grandson. I love my God .Dancing, spreading time with family and friends and watching sports."

Family is my foundation, and I love spending time with them, dancing, singing, and enjoying life’s simple joys.\r\n\r\n\r\nI began my career in childcare at age 16 and never left the field. I hold an Associate’s Degree in Early Childhood Education, a Bachelor of Science in Management, and as of April 2025, I’ll proudly hold a Master’s of Science in Psychology. I’m certified in First Aid, CPR, and Director Training, and hold licensure in multiple areas that support effective, joyful classrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeaching has always been my passion.s an educator and leader, I strive to inspire children to dream big and shine bright—because, in my eyes, the stars are just the beginning.",
